# customer-churn analysis
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow. The dataset from Kaggle undergoes extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and feature engineering to identify important factors such as contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and service usage patterns. Multiple models—including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)—are trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. To enhance reliability and performance, ensemble methods such as Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier are implemented, with the stacking model delivering the best overall results. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret model behavior, offering clear insights into feature importance and supporting explainable decision-making.

This repository provides a robust and business-ready churn prediction system that combines high performance with transparency. The workflow is designed to help telecom companies identify customers likely to leave and take proactive retention measures. The project demonstrates a strong blend of analytical depth, model experimentation, and explainability, making it valuable for both academic learning and practical deployment. Users can explore the notebook to understand the full modeling pipeline from data exploration to ensemble learning and SHAP visualizations showcasing a comprehensive and impactful approach to customer churn analysis.
